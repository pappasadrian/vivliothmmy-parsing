THMMY AUTh Undergraduate Thesis Repository Parsing and Data Analytics (vivliothmmy2.ee.auth.gr)

Several hundreds of Theses are uploaded and publicly available on the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki's Thesis Repository. However, the web interface is very basic and offers little to no functionality.

By parsing and looking into the data, much more info can be extracted.

## download.sh

This script does the initial grab of the whole database of theses. It will save all theses (PDFs) in a new "docs" subfolder, and will create a CSV file with all available data for each thesis from the webpage
